## Project Goal
My goal for this project was to apply my pre-requisite knowledge of operating systems in a fun and challenging way. I also wanted to learn more about the Windows API(Win32), Reverse Engineering, x86 Assembly, and GDI. I also used this as an opportunity to expand my knowledge of C++ programming and OOP.
 
## Help
This project could not have been built without the excellent tutorials provided by GuidedHacking. The process of finding offsets, reverse engineering, and writing the code required for memory reading/writing was learned from GuidedHacking.
